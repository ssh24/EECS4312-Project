This chapter shows how knowledge of the structure of a proof can guide inspections and reviews, even when the proof itself is not to be derived. The study illustrates, on a reduced example, the main issues which arose as part of the proof-based analysis of a specification of a tracking mechanism for a nuclear plant.},

	Abstract = {The specification language TLA+ was designed by Lamport for formally describing and reasoning about distributed algorithms. It is described in Lamport's book Specifying Systems [29], which also gives good advice on how to make the best use of TLA+ and its supporting tools. Systems are specified in TLA+ as formulas of the Temporal Logic of Actions, TLA, a variant of linear-time temporal logic also introduced by Lamport [27]. The underlying data structures are specified in (a variant of) Zermelo-Fr{\"a}nkel set theory, the language accepted by most mathematicians as the standard basis for formalizing mathematics. This choice is motivated by a desire for conciseness, clarity, and formality that befits a language of formal specification where executability or efficiency are not of major concern. TLA+ specifications are organized in modules that can be reused independently.},

	Abstract = {Software testing is an important activity in the software development life-cycle. In an earlier study in 2009, we reported the results of a regional survey of software testing practices among practitioners in the Canadian province of Alberta. To get a larger nationwide view on this topic (across Canada), we conducted a newer survey with a revised list of questions in 2010. Compared to our previous Alberta-wide survey (53 software practitioners), the nation-wide survey had larger number of participants (246 practitioners). We report the survey design, execution and results in this article. The survey results reveal important and interesting findings about software testing practices in Canada. Whenever possible, we also compare the results of this survey to other similar studies, such as the ones conducted in the US, Sweden and Australia, and also two previous Alberta-wide surveys, including our 2009 survey. The results of our survey will be of interest to testing professionals both in Canada and world-wide. It will also benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in software testing industry identifying the areas of strength and weakness, which would then hopefully encourage further industry-academia collaborations in this area. Among the findings are the followings: (1) the importance of testing-related training is increasing, (2) functional and unit testing are two common test types that receive the most attention and efforts spent on them, (3) usage of the mutation testing approach is getting attention among Canadian firms, (4) traditional Test-last Development (TLD) style is still dominating and a few companies are attempting the new development approaches such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), (5) in terms of the most popular test tools, NUnit and Web application testing tools overtook JUnit and IBM Rational tools, (6) most Canadian companies use a combination of two coverage metrics: decision (branch) and condition coverage, (7) number of passing user acceptance tests and number of defects found per day (week or month) are regarded as the most important quality assurance metrics and decision factors to release, (8) in most Canadian companies, testers are out-numbered by developers, with ratios ranging from 1:2 to 1:5, (9) the majority of Canadian firms spent less than 40% of their efforts (budget and time) on testing during development, and (10) more than 70% of respondents participated in online discussion forums related to testing on a regular basis.},

	Abstract = {With software's increasing role in safety-critical and security sensitive infrastructure it is of paramount importance to educate the next generation of software engineers in the use of high integrity development methods. In this paper we discuss our experience training undergraduate students in the use of SPARK toward the construction of a mission-critical embedded system. In particular the students designed and implemented the control program for a CubeSat nano-satellite that will orbit the Earth as the first step toward the ultimate goal of building a prototype CubeSat that will go to the Moon. Our work shows that inexperienced undergraduates can learn to use SPARK to produce more robust software than might otherwise be the case, even in the environment of a volatile student project.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, program verifiers and interactive theorem provers have become more powerful and more suitable for verifying large programs or proofs. This has demonstrated the need for improving the user experience of these tools to increase productivity and to make them more accessible to nonexperts. This paper presents an integrated development environment for Dafny---a programming language, verifier, and proof assistant---that addresses issues present in most state-of-the-art verifiers: low responsiveness and lack of support for understanding non-obvious verification failures. The paper demonstrates several new features that move the state-of-the-art closer towards a verification environment that can provide verification feedback as the user types and can present more helpful information about the program or failed verifications in a demand-driven and unobtrusive way.},

@conference{GF2014,
	Abstract = {The error detection in software is a problem that causes the loss of large amount of money in updates and patches. Many programmers spend their time correcting code instead of programming new features for their applications. This makes early detection of software errors become essential. Both in the fields of static analysis and model checking, great advances are being made to find errors in the software before the products are released. Although model checking techniques are more dedicated to find malware, it can be adapted for errors in the software. In this article we will discuss the techniques used today for the search of patterns and vulnerabilities within the software to know what are the possible solutions to this issue. We examine the problem from the point of view of their algorithms and their effectiveness in finding bugs. Although there are similar surveys, none of them addresses the comparison of best static analysis algorithms against the best mathematical logic languages for model checking, two fields that are becoming very important in the search for errors in software.},

As is often the case, the combinations can be classified according to how tightly the different components are integrated, their range of application, and their degree of automation.},

The system components are described as Hybrid Automata--communicating machines with finite control and real-valued variables that represent continuous environment parameters such as time, pressure, and temperature. The system requirements are specified in a temporal logic with stop watches, and verified by symbolic fixpoint computation. The verification procedure--implemented in the Hybrid Technology Tool, HyTech--applies to hybrid automata whose continuous dynamics is governed by linear constraints on the variables and their derivatives. We illustrate the method and the tool by checking safety, liveness, time-bounded, and duration requirements of digital controllers, schedulers, and distributed algorithms.},

developed by Matra Transport International for the RATP, requires a
very high level of dependability and safety for the users and the opera-
tor. To achieve this, the safety critical software located in the different
control units (ground, line and on-board) was developed using the B
formal method together with the Vital Coded Processor. This architec-
ture thus ensures an optimum level of safety agreed with the customer.
This experience with the METEOR project has convinced Matra Trans-
port International of the advantages of using this B formal method for
large-scale industrial developments.},

The first section discusses the history behind the trend, as well as the Agile Manifesto, a statement from the leaders of the Agile movement. The second section represents the State-of-the-Art and examines what it means to be Agile, discusses the role of management, describes and compares some of the more popular methods, provides a guide for deciding where an Agile approach is applicable, and lists common criticisms of Agile techniques. The third section represents State-of-the-Practice and summarizes empirical studies, anecdotal reports, and lessons learned. The report concludes with an Appendix that includes a detailed analysis of various Agile Methods for the interested reader.},

	Abstract = {This paper focuses on the challenges of modeling cyber-physical systems that arise from the intrinsic heterogeneity, concurrency, and sensitivity to timing of such systems. It uses a portion of an aircraft vehicle management systems (VMS), specifically the fuel management subsystem, to illustrate the challenges, and then discusses technologies that at least partially address the challenges. Specific technologies described include hybrid system modeling and simulation, concurrent and heterogeneous models of computation, the use of domain-specific ontologies to enhance modularity, and the joint modeling of functionality and implementation architectures.},

It discusses those aspects of airworthiness certification that pertain to the production of software, using formal methods for systems approved using DO- 178C. Formal methods are mathematically-based techniques for the specification, development and verification of software aspects of digital systems. The mathematical basis of formal methods consists of formal logic, discrete mathematics and computer-readable languages. The use of formal methods is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analyses can contribute to establishing the correctness and robustness of a design.}},

The text A Logical Approach to Discrete Math

David Gries and Fred B. Schneider, have written a text

A Logical Approach to Discrete Math (Springer Verlag, 1993),

which attempts to change how logic and discrete math is taught. Our thesis is that logic is the glue that binds together arguments in
all domains. But this requires a logic that lends itself to formal application by people. For this purpose, we use an equational logic,
in which substitution of equals for equals rather than modus ponens is the main inference rule.

We discuss principles and heuristics developing proofs and work toward giving students a skill in formal manipulation. Thereafter,
we use the logic in giving rigorous introductions to: set theory, mathematical induction, a theory of sequences, a theory of integers,
functions and relations, combinatorics, solving recurrence relations, and modern algebra.

Our experience is that students are far more positive about notation, proof, and rigor with our treatment than they are after a
conventional discrete math course. Many students say that they are now less apprehensive about mathematics and proof, and others
say they are using their new skill in formal manipulation in other courses. Some teachers who have used our text (in primarily
teaching institutions) say that the approach helps the weaker students more than the stronger ones. These experiences give us hope
that adoption of our approach can lead over the years to a radical change in the field's attitude toward proof and mathematics and its
ability to deal with formality.},

The Java Modelling Language (JML) is a behavioural interface specification language designed for specifying Java classes and interfaces. This paper defines a translation of OCL expressions and constraints into the Java Modelling Language. The objective of this translation is to be able to map UML object-oriented designs with OCL constraints to Java classes and interfaces annotated with JML specifications, and to carry out logical reasoning about such classes and interfaces using JML tools which include a run time assertion checker and an interactive prover based on PVS.},

	Abstract = {The record of successful applications of formal verification techniques is slowly growing. Our ultimate aim, however, is not to perform small pilot projects that show that verification is sometimes feasible in an industrial setting; our aim must be to firmly integrate verification techniques into the software design cycle as a non-negotiable part of quality control. Ultimately, the sale of a non-verified piece of software, or the standardization of a non-verified protocol or algorithm for use on computing machinery, should be as unthinkable as the prescription of untested, and potentially harmful, drugs for use by humans.

In the talk we take a snapshot of the state of the art in formal verification, and considers how well it has been integrated into industrial practice so far. For inspiration, we compare the current situation with other points in history where new technology threatened to replace old technology, only to discover how resilient an established practice can be, and how remarkably long it can manage hold out. To keep a mild sense of perspective, however, we will also briefly consider how badly mistaken some of the advocates of new technology have sometimes been, and how right the people were that stuck to the old ways just a little bit longer...},

	Abstract = {The present volume is the third in a series of VDM Symposia Proceedings. VDM, the Vienna Development Method, is a formal method for software engineering, Z refers to Zermelo, a mathematician whose name is associated with set theory. Many computing science, programming and software engineering proceedings are published regularly. The ones by VDM Europe have the distinguished mark that they are concerned with bringing real theory to apply to real programming. In Europe, there is very much interest in methodology, semantics and techniques, that is, in understanding how we build and what it is that we are building. The papers of these proceedings basically fall into four major groups: Applications, Methodology, Formalisations, and Foundations. The Methodology group has been further subdivided into five areas: Specification Methodology, Design Methodology, Modularity, Object Orientedness, and Processes, Concurrency and Distributed Systems.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: This paper describes the use of formal development methods on an industrial safety-critical application. The Z notation was used for documenting the system specification and part of the design, and the SPARK 1 subset of Ada was used for coding. However, perhaps the most distinctive nature of the project lies in the amount of proof that was carried out: proofs were carried out both at the Z level--approximately 150 proofs in 500 pages--and at the SPARK code level--approximately 9,000 verification conditions generated and discharged. The project was carried out under UK Interim Defence Standards 00-55 and 00-56, which require the use of formal methods on safety-critical applications. It is believed to be the first to be completed against the rigorous demands of the 1991 version of these standards. The paper includes comparisons of proof with the various types of testing employed, in terms of their efficiency at finding faults. The most striking result is that the Z proof appears to be substantially more efficient at finding faults than the most efficient testing phase. Given the importance of early fault detection, we believe this helps to show the significant benefit and practicality of large-scale proof on projects of this kind.},

	Abstract = {Test-first programming is one of the central techniques of extreme programming. Programming test-first means (i) write down a test-case before coding and (ii) make all the tests executable for regression testing. Thus far, knowledge about test-first programming is limited to experience reports. Nothing is known about the benefits of test-first compared to traditional programming (design, implementation, test). This paper reports an experiment comparing test-first to traditional programming. It turns out that test-first does not accelerate the implementation, and the resulting programs are not more reliable, but test-first seems to support better program understanding.},

Using this practice, we reduced our defect rate by about 50 percent compared to a similar system that was built using an ad-hoc unit testing approach. The project completed on time with minimal development productivity impact. Additionally, the suite of automated unit test cases created via TDD is a reusable and extendable asset that will continue to improve quality over the lifetime of the software system. The test suite will be the basis for quality checks and will serve as a quality contract between all members of the team.},

@misc{Mellor2004,
	Author = {Mellor, Stephen J.},
	Journal = {IEEE Software},
	Note = {Mr. Jarzabek raises several interesting technical points that, summarized ruthlessly, boil down to just two: models are insufficiently precise ({\"\i}¾overly abstract{\"\i}¾) to transform reliably into systems without a developer{\"\i}¾s interference, and models{\"\i}¾ multifaceted nature, in contrast to the block-structured nature of today{\"\i}¾s programming languages, introduces consistency and change-control issues. He{\"\i}¾s right. He{\"\i}¾s also correct identifying {\"\i}¾integrating partial specifications of problem semantics in different UML models (such as use cases, class diagrams and so on){\"\i}¾ as being {\"\i}¾big problems{\"\i}¾. This problem, exists because UML is defined as a set of separate {\"\i}¾models{\"\i}¾-diagrams, really that don{\"\i}¾t necessarily fit together to form a coherent, executable whole. In turn, this leads to {\"\i}¾a tremendous amount of delocalized information and redundancies across models.{\"\i}¾ I agree wholeheartedly. But this sorry siyuation isn't ineherent in MDD. You address both problems by defining a single underlying ground truth against which all diagrams are memerly views. A change in one diagram such as, such as adding a signal sebd to a state chart diagram, would then necessarily be reflected on the diagram that shows communication between state charts. Ground truth, a concept from game simulation that captures the notion of what{\"\i}¾s really going on irrespective of players{\"\i}¾ imperfect perceptions, is necessarily internally self-consistent, and it{\"\i}¾s one source for translation into systems. (The other source is a set of translation rules that are made explicit in MDD and can be controlled by the developer.) The executable-modeling community recognizes these flaws, and efforts are underway to define a standard, simplified, interchangeable ground truth that captures the executable essence of a single subject matter that can be woven together with others. This executable metamodel forms the basis of a tool chain of model compilers, checkers, and analyzers of various kinds. Each tool in the chain deals with ground truth, a tractable subset of UML semantics. Developers interact with subsets of the concrete syntax of UML for different users and methods and{\^A}more importantly{\^A} with domain-specific languages tailored to a user{\"\i}¾s domain. In Mr. Jarzabek{\"\i}¾s last paragraph, he says there{\"\i}¾s a {\"\i}¾wealth of experiences from automatic-programming research of the 1970{\^A}80s and CASE tools of the late 1980s{\"\i}¾ but doesn{\"\i}¾t enumerate any of them. At the same time, he says {\"\i}¾[i]t{\"\i}¾s time for software engineers to take a mature, evidence-based approach to supposedly new ideas,{\"\i}¾ another idea to which I can only roar assent. There are tools today that define an executable profile and use it, in industrial settings, to accrue the benefits he claims are hyperbole. Why, then, do other authors in this IEEE Software issue call these working systems a {\"\i}¾cocktail- party myth{\"\i}¾? I can{\"\i}¾t tell you; I can only point to the benefits, the decreasing costs derived from a standard tool chain, and working systems. Today. And that{\"\i}¾s no hype},

@techreport{Paige2000,
	Abstract = {A modeling language consists of both a notation and a metamodel, the latter of which captures the syntactic well-formedness constraints that all valid models must obey. We present two versions of a metamodel for an industrial-strength object-oriented modeling language, BON. The first version of the metamodel, written in BON itself, is intended to give a precise and understandable description of the syntactic well-formedness constraints. The second version, written in the PVS specification language, is intended to give a formal description of the constraints, in a form that is amenable to automated checking and analysis. We demonstrate how the PVS version can be used for conformance checking, i.e., showing that BON models satisfy or fail to satisfy the metamodel. A process is defined for using the metamodel in carrying out conformance testing of models. We also contrast the BON metamodel with the metamodel of the Unified Modelling Language (UML), both in terms of the precise metamodel presented in the UML Semantics Reference, and a formalization of the metamodel presented in the Alloy specification language. We discuss lessons learned in constructing metamodels, particularly in terms of using the PVS specification language for metamodeling.},

The motivation for this research is to quantitatively investigate common perceptions about open-source projects, and to validate these perceptions through an empirical study. We investigate the hypothesis that open-source software grows more quickly, but does not find evidence to support this. The project growth is similar for all the projects in the analysis, indicating that other factors may limit growth. The hypothesis that creativity is more prevalent in open-source software is also examined, and evidence to support this hypothesis is found using the metric of functions added over time. The concept of open-source projects succeeding because of their simplicity is not supported by the analysis, nor is the hypothesis of open-source projects being more modular. However, the belief that defects are found and fixed more rapidly in open-source projects is supported by an analysis of the functions modified. We find support for two of the five common beliefs and conclude that, when implementing or switching to the open-source development model, practitioners should ensure that an appropriate metrics collection strategy is in place to verify the perceived benefits.},

	Abstract = {ROOM is a new object-oriented methodology for the development of real-time systems that is supported by a commercial CASE toolset. The idea is to establish an early operational model and then grow it; thus there is an iterative development cycle using the tool, with an early execution capability. The system gradually takes form as more is learned about the system (analysis) and alternative solutions are explored (design). This is achieved through the construction and verification of initially abstract executable analysis and design models which are gradually refined to final versions. Clearly, these activities must be computer based, not paper based.},

A by-product of this study is an alternative proof to that contained in [GS3], that the full Leibniz rule is strictly stronger than the no-capture Leibniz rule, this result obtained here for a complete Logic. We also show that under some reasonable conditions, propositional Leibniz, no-capture Leibniz, and a full-capture version are all equivalent, provided that the latter is restricted to act on universally valid premises whenever capture is allowed.},
